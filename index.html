      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="profile-desc" >My name is Aled and I'm right at the start of my adventures in programming and Web Design.
        This is the first website I've built (with a bit of help from the good folks at the <a href="https://www.appbrewery.co/">App Brewery</a>).
        It's really a work in progress, but I'm excited about it.
        I hope you like it.

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>  I'm currently learning to speak HTML and CSS. It's very early days, but it's really amazing how much I've learnt in just a week.
          Once you wrap your head around the basic concepts, it's very intuitive.
          I love running up against problems and trying to find the solutions.

        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>For a number of years I have also run my own photography business.
          Through photography I have developed a deep understanding of the visual asthetic as well as a keen eye for detail.
          I have also learnt the importance of working well with people, and the value of collaborative working in any succesful creative process.
